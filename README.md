# timestamp-photos

*Install before running:*
- pip install Pillow
- pip install pillow-heif

*Customize:*

* "directory_path" variable in tsphotos.py. This where the photos you want to timestamp are.
* "photo_width" and "photo_height" variables to the print dimensions you expect. Default is 4x6.
* "font_path" - currently defaults to [IBMPlexSans-Regular.ttf](https://github.com/IBM/plex) which is a font I like. Feel free to change this. Look in ~/Library/Fonts for ideas.

*Run like this:*
* python tsphotos.py
